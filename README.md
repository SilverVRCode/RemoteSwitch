# What is RemoteSwitch?
RemoteSwitch was developed for the DeltaHacks XI hackathon. It is a platform intended to let users connect their Nintendo Switch to an online platform, allowing for a second person to play along remotely.
All it requires is a high-speed capture card and a fast connection (>50mbps).
