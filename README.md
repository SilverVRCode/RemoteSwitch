# What is RemoteSwitch?
RemoteSwitch was developed for the DeltaHacks XI hackathon. It is a platform intended to let users connect their Nintendo Switch to an online platform, allowing for a second person to play along remotely.
All it requires is a capture card (capable of low-latency streaming) and a high-speed internet connection
